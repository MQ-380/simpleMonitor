A Simple Store Situation Monitor by React

The first time, I have no chance to get the new iPhone on first day.
So, I found the store API by console,  wrote this simple React webpage to take a glance at which store in China has the new iPhone in store in 1 hour.

It's too simple to do any other thing. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

If I have time, I think it can be more useful. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

Using:
'npm run start' is all.
