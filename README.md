A Simple Store Situation Monitor by React

The first time, I have no chance to get the new iPhone(iPhone 12 Pro Max) on first day.
So, I found the store API by console, in one hour, I wrote this simple React webpage to take a glance at which store in China has the new iPhone 12 Pro Max in store.

It's too simple to do any other thing. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

If I have time, I think it can be more useful. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

Using:
'npm run start' is all.
